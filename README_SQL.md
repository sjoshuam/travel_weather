# Overview
This SQL project is an add-on to the primary Python project. The main project
scores the temperateness of the weather for each of my planned read trip routes.
This project creates an SQL database of weather scores to facilitate
customized, ad hoc searches.  It is entirely based on data projects from the
main project.

Aside from convenience queries, this is
mostly for practice purposes.
